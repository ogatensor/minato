### Routing API

The Routing API is responsible for finding the most efficient routes for the OFA to execute trades. This process involves calculating the optimal routes based on various factors such as gas costs, liquidity, and market conditions.

The Routing API plays a crucial role in optimizing the OFA's execution strategy, ensuring that trades are executed at the best possible prices while minimizing costs.

For more information on the Routing API and its implementation, please refer to the [[#alloy-rs|alloy-rs]] documentation.
