# Counterfactual Analysis

## Overview

This document outlines the design considerations and approaches for implementing counterfactual analysis in the context of decentralized exchanges and token trading. The goal is to provide a robust and flexible framework for evaluating the impact of various factors on trading outcomes.

## Hybrid Approaches

### Thresholding the Similarity Analysis

* **Description:** This approach combines the strict conditional analysis with a degree of similarity analysis. Instead of seeking the absolute closest possible world for the counterfactual, a threshold of similarity is set. This retains some robustness while allowing for contextual factors that the strict analysis might exclude.
* **Implementation:** Implement a thresholding mechanism that allows for a range of similarity values to be considered when generating counterfactual baselines. This can be achieved by introducing a similarity metric and a threshold value, where the counterfactual baseline is selected based on the similarity score.

### Weighted Similarity

* **Description:** In a similarity analysis, not all factors need to be equally important. This approach involves weighting factors (e.g., network congestion, token liquidity) so that the counterfactual baseline prioritizes similarity in the most critical aspects, providing some flexibility while ensuring the comparison's core parameters are aligned.
* **Implementation:** Implement a weighting mechanism that allows for the assignment of importance weights to different factors. This can be achieved by introducing a weighting scheme, where the similarity score is calculated based on the weighted importance of each factor.

## Enhancing the Strict Conditional Approach

### Sensitivity via Multiple Baselines

* **Description:** Even within the strict conditional analysis, running simulations generating multiple counterfactual baselines using slightly altered parameters provides insight into how sensitive the results are to small input changes, mirroring the uncertainty focus of similarity analysis.
* **Implementation:** Implement a mechanism to generate multiple counterfactual baselines with slightly altered parameters. This can be achieved by introducing a parameter perturbation scheme, where the parameters are randomly perturbed within a defined range.

### Domain-Specific Validity Criteria

* **Description:** The strict conditional analysis relies on logically valid relationships, but what constitutes "validity" can be influenced by the domain. Including rules specific to decentralized exchanges or the tokens being traded makes validity criteria more contextually robust.
* **Implementation:** Implement domain-specific rules and constraints that define the validity criteria for the counterfactual analysis. This can be achieved by introducing a set of domain-specific rules and constraints that are applied during the counterfactual generation process.

## Addressing the Gas Cost Limitation

### Similarity as a Benchmark

* **Description:** Use a similarity analysis not to replace the strict conditional baseline, but to benchmark it. Are prices generated under the similarity approach wildly different? This might hint at an overly restrictive counterfactual in the strict conditional case.
* **Implementation:** Implement a mechanism to compare the results of the strict conditional analysis with the similarity analysis. This can be achieved by running both approaches in parallel and comparing the generated prices.

### Heuristics from Similarity

* **Description:** If the similarity analysis consistently includes factors the strict analysis overlooks, adapt the strict analysis to incorporate those parameters. Maybe consistent liquidity differences between possible worlds force you to re-evaluate how you generate counterfactuals.
* **Implementation:** Implement a mechanism to incorporate insights from the similarity analysis into the strict conditional analysis. This can be achieved by introducing a feedback loop, where the results of the similarity analysis are used to refine the parameters and rules used in the strict conditional analysis.

## Caveat

* **Description:** Striking the right balance between these approaches is delicate. Too much similarity focus risks losing the comparability rigor the strict analysis provides.
* **Implementation:** Implement a mechanism to balance the trade-off between the strict conditional analysis and the similarity analysis. This can be achieved by introducing a hyperparameter that controls the relative importance of each approach.

## Implementation Notes

* The implementation should be modular and flexible to accommodate different approaches and parameters.
* The system should provide a clear and intuitive interface for configuring the counterfactual analysis parameters and rules.
* The system should be able to handle large datasets and perform computations efficiently.
* The system should provide robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure reliability and debugability.
