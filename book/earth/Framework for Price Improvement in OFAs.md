## [[Framework for Price Improvement in OFAs]]
The paper proposes a framework to define and evaluate price improvements in onchain Order Flow Auctions (OFAs). This includes:

1. **[[Price Definition]]**: A definition of "price" that internalizes the gas cost of the transaction, making it applicable across different OFA implementations.
2. **[[Price Improvement]] Definition**: Price improvement ($\pi$) is defined as the relative difference between the realized price ($p$) and a baseline/counterfactual price ($p'$).
3. **[[Counterfactual Price Generation]]**: The baseline/counterfactual price ($p'$) is generated by simulating the trade using the [[Uniswap Routing API]] and the [[Tenderly Simulator]], to mimic what a typical user could achieve outside of the OFA.
4. **[[Attribution Model]]**: The paper proposes a model to attribute the price improvement to various controllable inputs like routing efficiency, gas optimization, and priority fee settings.
