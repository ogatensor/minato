### Baseline Function ($B$) - Earth (土)

The baseline generation function can be interpreted through the lens of Wuxing theory as follows:

- **Optimal Route Calculation** - Wood (木)
- **Gas Cost Estimation** - Fire (火)
- **Simulation** - Water (水)

These mappings can be added to the Obsidian documentation to provide a comprehensive view of how traditional Wuxing elements are integrated into various financial metrics and formulas across the codebase. This approach not only aids in understanding the mathematical models but also enriches them with philosophical insights, making the analysis more robust and multidimensional.
