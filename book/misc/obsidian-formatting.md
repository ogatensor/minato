To emulate the approach of combining internal linking with hashtag notation in Obsidian for enhanced documentation, follow these steps:

### 1. **Identify Key Concepts and Sections**
   - Start by identifying the key concepts, terms, and sections within your document that you want to highlight or make easily accessible.

### 2. **Create Internal Links**
   - Use double brackets `[[ ]]` to create links to other documents or specific sections within the same document. This is useful for connecting related concepts and providing easy navigation to detailed explanations or related discussions.
   - Example: `[[Realized Price Definition#Input Token|Input Token]]`

### 3. **Add Hashtag Notation for Tagging**
   - Use hashtags `#` to tag specific terms or concepts within your document. This allows for quick searching and categorization within the Obsidian vault.
   - Example: `(#Input_Token)`

### 4. **Combine Both Notations**
   - When you link to a section or a concept, immediately follow the link with a hashtag notation to tag that specific part of the text. This dual approach enhances both the navigability (through links) and the searchability (through tags) of your document.
   - Example: `Input token amount ($i$): [[Realized Price Definition#Input Token|Input Token]](#Input_Token)`

### 5. **Use Descriptive Text for Links**
   - When creating links, use descriptive text that clearly indicates what the link is about. This helps in understanding the context without needing to follow the link immediately.
   - Example: Instead of just `[[Link]]`, use `[[Realized Price Definition#Input Token|Input Token]]`.

### 6. **Document Layout and Structure**
   - Organize your document with clear headers and subheaders. Use navigation sections if necessary to outline the document structure at the beginning or end of the document.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     ## Navigation
     - [[#Overview|Overview]]
     - [[#Mathematical Formulations|Mathematical Formulations]]
     ```

### 7. **Regular Review and Update**
   - Regularly review your document to ensure that all links and tags are up to date and that they correctly reflect the content of the linked or tagged sections. Update as necessary to maintain coherence and accuracy.

### 8. **Testing and Feedback**
   - Test the document within the Obsidian environment to ensure that all links and tags work as expected. Obtain feedback from other users or colleagues to see if the document meets their needs and adjust accordingly.

By following these steps, you can effectively use internal linking and hashtag notation in Obsidian to create a well-organized, easily navigable, and searchable document. This approach is particularly useful for complex documents where quick access to related concepts and sections is beneficial.
