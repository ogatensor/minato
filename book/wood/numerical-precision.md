# Numerical Precision Concerns for Orderflow Auction Analysis Considerations

## Overview
This section discusses the importance of numerical precision in financial calculations, particularly when working with real money. It highlights the potential issues that can arise from using floating-point arithmetic, which is the standard in many programming languages, including Rust.

## Floating-Point Errors
The author notes that floating-point errors can be "disastrous" when working with real money. To mitigate this, it is common to use integer types (including pennies as the last two digits) or fixed-point libraries for financial calculations.

## Rust and IEEE-754 Standard
Rust, like many other languages, uses the [[IEEE-754 Standard|IEEE-754 standard]] to represent floating-point numbers. This can lead to small discrepancies between the expected and actual output due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic.

## Ethereum and Floating-Point Types
The author points out that the IEEE-754 standard for floating-point arithmetic is not applicable in the Ethereum environment, as [[Solidity]] (the programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts) does not have floating-point types. This means that the numerical precision concerns discussed are more relevant for off-chain computations and simulations that are performed in support or in conjunction with on-chain protocols.
